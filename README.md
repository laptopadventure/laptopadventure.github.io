# Reading Notes

This repository holds my reading notes for code fellows. I update it with my own notes occasionally.

## About Me

> I'm a new student for Code Fellows, who started coding in 2017 as a self learning coder contributing to an open contribution repository. I like camping with my friends, and travelling the world. I'm hoping to become proficient with the front end of development.

Unfortunately missed a lot of these, but I feel good about the quality of notes taken.

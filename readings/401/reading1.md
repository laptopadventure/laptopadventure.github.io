## Intro to Node.js


* Describe Node to a non-technical friend?
  * Node.js is, quite simply, how we run JavaScript on our computer. Browsers use Node for running JavaScript on websites, sure, but Node.js has features unrelated to anything involving browsers. So again: Node.js is how we run JavaScript, which makes it a 'runtime'
* What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
  * It means that if you want to run a .js file, you use node. Node can be used in the cli to execute the files. Remember, Node is HOW Javascript runs
* What is Node used for
  * Besides the above stuff which I mean, RUNNING JavaScript in the first place is a huge deal, it comes with the package manager, which has over 1,000,000 packages of JS code to use in projects which is crazy. Using Node and npm, you can automate many processes of a modern JS application. Bundling assets, testing your code, even auto code and style linting. Packages are OP.
  * But also, consider that Node.js lets us run JS as a server for backend work, which is also huge. Modern webapps can have up to 90% Javascript both frontend and backend, it's a bit wild.
  * Outside of webdev, Node.js can be used for writing command line tools, desktop apps, even robots

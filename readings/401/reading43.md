### First Timer's Only

- Contributing is fun
  - Feeling helpful, productive, useful, supporting projects you enjoy deeper than a surface level supporter.
- OSS Projects should add "First Timers Only" tag to easy projects
  - Gets people engaged, joining in
  - Lowers the initial hurdle to get into contributions
  - Contributor might stay, add more

### Github's Guide to Open Source

- Contribute to software you rely on
  - It should be something you're already familiar with, because then you know how it works in practice, and you can look at the code and have that frame of reference for understanding what the code does. It does... what you've used!
  - You might also know of some issues to fix in the first place.
- Meet people
  - OSS Communities are full of incredibly talented coders, and you can form lifelong friendships.
  - Because of the wide array of talent, it can be possible to find a mentor for learning more about code. Ask questions!
- It gives you power.
  - It feels incredibly good to be the person who went in and fixed it.

### What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

1. It builds your skills
  - Time practicing helps so much. If you're coding every day, you're learning how to become a better coder every day.
2. It's good on portfolios.
  - It's easy experience you can slap on a resume, having say, a year of OSS contributions is a fantastic little bonus on any portfolio. Should help for internships.
3. Community
  - OSS Communities are full of great people you can learn a lot from, and in general it's pretty light-hearted.
4. Greater Job Prospects
  - Interviewers like to skim the github of the people they're hiring. If the resume is good, and the github is good, you stand a good chance of landing a job.
5. It makes software you use better.
  - You use something as a User, you know the issues with it, you fix it, you've made it better from your own perspective. It was YOUR idea implemented, you can't dislike the change you made.

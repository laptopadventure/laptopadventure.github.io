## The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of

This article talks about how a learning coder was asked to program a deceitful feature that recommended users purchase medication they might or might not need, compounded by the fact that the medication was for young girls. And worse, one of the users who took it suffered from a suicidal side effect, and ended up taking her life. I've always said myself that I'd take most coding jobs just to get some experience in the industry before I get pick-and-choose, but this story narrowed my qualifications a bit. If I'd say I wouldn't work for a company that has terrible standards for those working there, I'd also add in companies that directly harm people for profit. At least with facebook the data harvesting is morally murky but doesn't kill people, a website telling people to buy drugs regardless of what it might do is outright horrendous. I would never work at a place like that.

## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

This article talks about how much data we're producing each year, how every year we eclipse the sheer amount of data we make from all years prior, and how we use it to train AI. There's been warnings about how these AI might threaten humanity with enough intelligence. Personally, I'm a long time fan of AI's development, and right away I'd say we are not developing "true" AI. Our current AI is trained in specific tasks, and once it is complete, it does not train further, and definitely doesn't train itself. The kind of AI that people are scared of is the AI that talks and feels and acts like us, but better. Still, there are risks like AI taking jobs or more realistically lower the amount of humans needed for a service. A lot of cashiers got replaced by auto-checkout, and the remaining are trained to manage the autos. If enough fields of people lose their job to AI, we're going to have a crisis where unemployment soars and the fundamentals of capitalism, working for merit, is shaken. From it, there will be dark, dark times, but from that, we might enter an age of prosperity. Wherever we go, I am someone who is always pushing to advance forward.

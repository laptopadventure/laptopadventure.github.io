## react hello world

- What are the building blocks of a React app?
  - Elements, and components.
- What is the difference between an element and a React component?
  - Elements are small, simple objects that mimic html elements you'd write while making an html page
  - Components are functions that render into elements, but allow us to write custom behavior for said elements!
- What are some advantages of Reactâ€™s component based architecture?
  - React embraces mixing rendering the webpage and ui logic, unlike base html. In base html + js, the html is a static page, and the js script modifies it afterwards by listening for events and mutating the page post-render.
  - But that sucks! Components hold both the logic and the ui, and we are so much better for it.

## introducing JSX

- What is JSX and why do we use it?
Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
  - Well, definitely see the the above part on the advantages of component-based architecture. But beyond that, the jsx filetype allows for smarter errors and warning messages, since you're explicitly telling your IDE to lint for that with the filename.
- Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.
  - Yes, because React handles sanitization for you. If a user input was malicious on dry html + js, you are expected to put your sanitization in, lest someone inject a js script or iframe which could do god-knows-what damage.

## rendering elements

- Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.
  - Components are blueprints the code reads to make elements, which are building blocks for the visuals and logic of a website.
- Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?
  - React elements are immutable, they are simply the results of rendering and cannot be changed in any way. UI is updated by re-rendering to create new versions of the elements. 
- If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?
  - React re-renders only to the level it is required. That means if you changed something on the header, react wouldn't re-render the entire webpage, only the header and children of the header.

## Importance

Diversity and Computer Science and software development has been a long time discussion had in the tech industry, and definitely an uphill battle historically. It's important to discuss and be informed about the what and why of diversity in the workplace, for a better, more equally represented future with both equal opportunity and products made from and for everyone.

## Reading

* What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  * The home computers began emerging, and in their very primitive state they were mostly good for games like pong. And since the new industry made a major push on the games being for boys and men, the computer followed suit as being seen that way as well.
* Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  * Because growing comfortable with computers is the gateway to tinkering with them yourself, which is in essence what coding is. If the use of a computer has been mostly men, any woman wanting to shift into computer science was already behind as they didn't have the "global" knowledge that someone who grew up with them (much more likely because of game marketing) would have.

## Videos

* When are diversity efforts most successful?
  * Success in building diversity comes from strong leadership committed towards the change from an understanding of what makes it important and the benefits it provides.
* Why do diverse companies perform better?
  * A more diverse set of minds can come up with a wider range of creative solutions to a problem, because of the larger collection of experiences by the team.
  * Turning away diverse backgrounds leads to missing talent, and thus making worse product.
* Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  * Youtube's almost entirely right-handed developer team designed an app that was very clunky for left-handed people to use, a problem that could have been avoided if there was more left-handed insight during the design process.

## Things I want to know more about

* I want to learn more about the much larger asian presence in tech than I was aware of. Looking at the demographics page, it seems that every company had a larger demographic of asian employees than the US population percentage, which is really interesting. Just as the marketing, stereotypes and culture of the 1980's defined men as the leaders in computer science, I wonder if those same factors had given an advantage here. It's interesting to think about. I also considered the fact that the west coast has the Silicon Valley, and also a larger presence of Asians, so perhaps the locational influences mattered as well.
